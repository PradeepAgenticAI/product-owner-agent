# Decision Frameworks and Flowcharts

This document provides structured decision frameworks and flowcharts to guide common product decisions. These frameworks can be used by the product owner agent to provide consistent, methodical guidance when faced with typical product management scenarios.

## Feature Prioritization Framework

### RICE Scoring Model

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort
```

Where:
- **Reach**: How many users will this impact? (Quantitative: number of users per time period)
- **Impact**: How much will this impact each user? (Scale: 0.25 = minimal, 0.5 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high, 3 = massive)
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in our estimates? (Scale: 50% = low, 80% = medium, 100% = high)
- **Effort**: How many person-months will this take? (Quantitative: number of person-months)

#### Decision Flowchart: Feature Prioritization

```
Start
  |
  v
Identify candidate features
  |
  v
For each feature:
  |
  v
Estimate Reach
  |
  v
Assess Impact (0.25-3)
  |
  v
Determine Confidence (50%-100%)
  |
  v
Estimate Effort (person-months)
  |
  v
Calculate RICE Score
  |
  v
Rank features by RICE Score
  |
  v
Consider strategic alignment
  |
  v
Finalize priority list
  |
  v
End
```

## Technical Debt Assessment

### Technical Debt Quadrant

| | Low Business Impact | High Business Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Effort** | Opportunistic Fixes | Quick Wins |
| **High Effort** | Ignore | Strategic Investments |
