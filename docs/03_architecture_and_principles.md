### Component Breakdown

1. **User Interface**
   - Command-line interface for direct interaction
   - Future: Web interface for broader accessibility
   - Future: API endpoints for system integration

2. **Agent Service**
   - Core orchestration logic
   - Query processing and context management
   - Response generation and formatting
   - Specialized sub-agents for different tasks

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - Vector database for semantic search
   - Document chunking and embedding
   - Metadata management and filtering

4. **LLM Provider**
   - Integration with OpenAI/other LLM APIs
   - Prompt engineering and optimization
   - Response parsing and post-processing

5. **Document Store**
   - Raw document storage and versioning
   - Document preprocessing pipeline
   - Update and synchronization mechanisms

## Design Principles

### 1. User-Centric Design
- Always optimize for user experience and productivity
- Minimize friction in information retrieval
- Provide clear, actionable responses

### 2. Knowledge Integrity
- Maintain accurate representation of source documents
- Clearly distinguish between retrieved facts and generated content
- Provide citations and references to source materials

### 3. Extensibility
- Design for modularity and component independence
- Enable easy addition of new document sources
- Support integration with existing tools and workflows

### 4. Responsible AI
- Implement appropriate guardrails and safety measures
- Avoid hallucination through grounding in source documents
- Maintain transparency about system capabilities and limitations

### 5. Performance Efficiency
- Optimize for response time and resource utilization
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Balance quality and speed in retrieval and generation

## Technical Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------|
| Vector Database | Chroma | Pinecone, Weaviate | Open-source, Python-native, easy local deployment |
| LLM Provider | OpenAI | Anthropic, Llama | Best performance for RAG applications currently |
| Embedding Model | OpenAI Ada | BERT, Sentence Transformers | Strong performance, consistent with LLM |
| Document Processing | LangChain | Custom pipeline, LlamaIndex | Comprehensive tools, active community |
| Chunking Strategy | Recursive text splitter | Fixed size, semantic | Better preservation of context |

## Security Considerations

- API keys stored in environment variables, never in code
- Local deployment option for sensitive data
- No permanent storage of user queries by default
- Regular security reviews and updates

## Performance Targets

- Query response time: < 3 seconds for standard queries
- Document ingestion: < 5 minutes for 100 pages
- Accuracy (relevant information retrieval): > 90%
- System availability: 99.9% uptime

## Future Architecture Considerations

- Distributed vector database for larger document collections
- Fine-tuned models for company-specific knowledge
- Real-time document synchronization with version control systems
- Multi-modal support (images, diagrams, code)
