# Glossary of Terms

This document provides a centralized glossary of terms used throughout the product documentation to ensure consistent understanding and usage of terminology.

## A

### Agile
An iterative approach to software development and project management that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.

### Acceptance Criteria
Predefined requirements that must be met for a user story or feature to be considered complete and acceptable.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

## B

### Backlog
A prioritized list of features, user stories, tasks, and bugs that need to be addressed in the product development process.

### Burndown Chart
A graphical representation of work left to do versus time in a sprint or project.

### Bug
An error, flaw, or fault in the software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result.

## C

### Continuous Integration (CI)
The practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
The practice of automatically preparing code changes for release to production.

### Continuous Deployment
The practice of automatically deploying code changes to production after passing automated tests.

### Change Failure Rate
The percentage of changes that result in degraded service or require remediation.

## D

### DevOps
A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software.

### Deployment Frequency
How often an organization successfully releases to production.

### Definition of Done (DoD)
A shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, ensuring transparency and quality.

## E

### Epic
A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories.

### End-to-End Testing
A methodology used to test whether the flow of an application from start to finish behaves as expected.

## F

### Feature Flag
A technique that allows teams to modify system behavior without changing code, enabling controlled rollouts and A/B testing.

### Feature Branch
A branch in version control created to develop a specific feature isolated from the main codebase.

## I

### Iteration
A time-boxed period (typically 1-4 weeks) during which a team works to complete a set amount of work.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

## K

### Kanban
A visual framework used to implement Agile that focuses on just-in-time delivery and managing the amount of work in progress.

### KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
A measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives.

## L

### Lead Time
The time it takes from a customer making a request to the request being satisfied.

### Lead Time for Changes
The time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production.

## M

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
A version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development.

### Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
The average time it takes to recover from a failure in the system.

### Microservices
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## P

### Product Backlog
A prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and requirements.

### Product Owner
The person responsible for maximizing the value of the product by managing the product backlog.

### Pull Request (PR)
A method of submitting contributions to a project, allowing code review before changes are merged.

## R

### Retrospective
A meeting held at the end of an iteration to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how to improve.

### Roadmap
A high-level visual summary that outlines the vision and direction of a product over time.

### Release
A distribution of a specific version of software to users or customers.

## S

### Scrum
An agile framework for managing complex work, emphasizing iterative progress and team collaboration.

### Sprint
A time-boxed iteration in Scrum, typically 1-4 weeks long.

### Stakeholder
Any person or group with an interest in a project's outcome.

### Story Points
A unit of measure for expressing the overall size/complexity of a user story.

## T

### Technical Debt
The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
A development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: write a failing test, make it pass, then refactor.

### Trunk-Based Development
A source-control branching model where developers collaborate on code in a single branch (trunk), avoiding long-lived feature branches.

## U

### User Story
An informal, natural language description of features of a software system, written from the perspective of an end user.

### Unit Testing
A software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested.

## V

### Velocity
A measure of the amount of work a team can complete during a single sprint.

### Value Stream
The series of steps an organization uses to build and deliver products or services to customers.

## W

### WIP (Work in Progress)
The number of work items that a team is currently working on.

### Waterfall
A linear sequential approach to software development where progress flows downwards through phases like requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
